## Client Introduction
Our database is tailored specifically to suit the needs of both casual and avid Pokemon game players. The Pokemon player base is very large. In 2021, Pokemon Go alone had 71 million active users.
## Current Situation
Currently, players are playing the game and learning about the interactions of different pokemons and their abilities. However, it is difficult to keep track of these interactions and best abilities to use on specific pokemon or types of pokemon. Therefore, players would benefit tremendously from having access to a relational database that they would be able to query and extract useful information pertaining to the game.
